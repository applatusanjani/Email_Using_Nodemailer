# Email_Using_Nodemailer
Here I used express,nodemon,mysql,and nodemailer to build this project.
Here you can send mail using three ways:
- using third party app.
- send mail to single id.
- send mail by reteriving data from database.
Also we can send data(body present in table) from our database to the particular id.
Database Servers: DBeaver and Xampp.
